# Copepod-Transcriptomic-Profiling-Tcal
# Objective: Evaluate gene expression patterns across stages of ontogenetic development in the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus using bulk RNA-sequencing.
# Preprocessing_Mapping_Counts: HTML describing preprocessing of paired-end reads generated from Illumina Stranded mRNA Prep and 150 bp sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000 at the University of California San Diegoâ€™s IGM Genomics Center.
